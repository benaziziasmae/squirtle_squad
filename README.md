# Visualisation : Pokemon OCR & Price Comparator

## Deliverable 2

This repository hosts source code & background information for a Pokemon TCG card scanner & price checker. This Readme will exclusively dedicated to Deliverable 2/Visualization.

## Main problematic to resolve

Our main goal is to create an application that accepts user inputted images and then provide an interface to show the user market prices and the card's legalities in the Pokemon Trading Card Game's playing formats. tha's mean 

In this Deliverable Our team is working on analysing the Pokemon Data gathered from [Pokemon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/) and contained the record of plenty of pokemon exposing cards and set details in an easy to consume format.

The base information provided are:
- Pokemon Name
- Release date 
- Legality 
- Images
- prices

## Data Transformation 

Using Python, The database that have been pulled from the Pokemon TCG API was firstly examinated to identify the variables that we want to work with, then cleaned to keep only  the meaningful variables.
After, we load the data Set into a .csv file

## Visualization of the pokemon cards 

The final visualization is anticipated as an HTML page that would consist of prices & image of the card.


## Mchine learning 

Team members submit the code for the machine learning model. It's a work in progress and we are still deciding on what model is best to use.
